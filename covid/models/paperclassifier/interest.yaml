# This yaml defines the subjects of interests (classes) for covid-paper.
# It contains not only the subjects of interests, but also the synonyms of it
# This is the basic but important keywords that we define for 
# the subject of interest. We can furthur use nltk synompns library 
# or word2vec this easily

# level: class --> subclass --> keywords

# Since we are using nltk to expand the synonyms. Some time, nltk
# does not work well (e.g., "exercise" synonyms include "do"). Therefore
# we will manually check and determine whether a sublcass should use
# nltk to expand it
