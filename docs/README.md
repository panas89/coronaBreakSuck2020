# 07/12/20 Improvement plan
1. Focus on keywords that make more senes to doctors in topic modeling result presentation; filter away phrases that are not medical-related and doctor-understandable in topic modeling
    1. Use abstract only for topic-modeling
    2. Created a knowledge base that contains a lot of keywords that make senses to doctor
        1. Knowledge base: e.g., MeSH term
    3. The topic modeling keyword results should be presented after filtering by the knowledge base and then by whether the keywords have strong relationship (via the relation extractor)
2. Allow these visualization capabilities: view by paper (focus on papers with high impact factor only), by region (where the publication is published).
